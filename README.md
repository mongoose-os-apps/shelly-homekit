# Apple HomeKit firmware for Shelly switches

This firmware exposes [Shelly 1](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1-smart-home-automation-relay/), [Shelly 1PM](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1pm-smart-home-automation-relay/), [Shelly Plug S](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-plug-s-smart-home-automation-device/), Shelly 2 and [Shelly 2.5](https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-25-smart-home-automation-relay/) as Apple HomeKit accessories.

Firmware is compatible with stock and can be uploaded via OTA (Watch a 2 minute [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZc-kp4dDRw)), for more info take a look at the flashing wiki [here](Flashing#updating-from-stock-firmware).

At the moment only the following functionality is supported:
 * Switch functionality - all relevant models, with auto-off and separate input tile as an option.
 * Power measurement: only Shelly 2.5, not Shelly1PM
 * Roller-shutter mode (Shelly 2.5 only)

Reverting to stock firmware is also supported [see here](Flashing#reverting-to-stock-firmware).

*Note:* Only HomeKit is supported, no Shelly Cloud, MQTT or web hooks for now.
